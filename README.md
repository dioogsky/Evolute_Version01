# Evolute_Version01

 This is a game named Evolute.
 
 The name of this game is solving puzzles while also avoiding an enemy in space. You take the helm as the last human ship escaping a tragedy on Earth. As you tap your way through these intergalactic challenges, you are your enemy is following close behind, waiting for you to fall into their maniacal clutches.

 I used a open source library "perspective" to control the camera.
 
 I will implement an enemy AI system, but it's really hard. I may use jumper library which was developed by MIT. You can find it on github.

 I'm a newbie...whatever, I believe I can make it.
